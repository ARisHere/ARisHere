## üöÄ About Me

üéì I am Md. Ahadur Rohman Ahad, a **Front End Developer** (specializing in **Web and Android**), and I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at the Bangladesh Army University of Engineering & Technology (BAUET) in 2024.

üë®‚Äçüíª I enjoy contributing to **Open Source Projects** and have worked with **SheBa Web Technology LLC**. I am enthusiastic about learning new technology. This year I learned about **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** and contributed my knowledge to a **Crop Disease Detection Project**. Now I am working with research on **Machine Learning** and **Bioinformatics**.

üé∏ Outside the tech world too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from **Volunteering** with multiple organizations including, **Fire Service and Civil Defence**, **Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS)** and **Bangladesh National Cadet Corps (BNCC)**
